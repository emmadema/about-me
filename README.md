## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I like the idea of working for a startup or a small buissness. I would like a compny that cares about its employees. I belive I thrive best in an open workplace where interaction with coworks is encourgaed. I also enjoy the freedom to work on my own without constanst supervision. Ideally there will also be dogs there. 

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I like frontend right now. My ideal role would be something where I could test website security. I would love to try and hack into a website and see where the security breanches are to allow a comapny to improve security. I dont even know if this exists but that would be awesome.
